# Large Files Excluded from Repository

The following files exceed GitHub's size limits and should be handled separately:

## Excluded Files
- List large files that were removed
- Include their original size
- Include instructions for handling them separately

## Recommendations
1. Store large files using Git LFS (Large File Storage)
2. Host media files on a dedicated service
3. Split large datasets into smaller chunks if possible
4. Use compressed formats where appropriate

Note: Maintain the repository size under 100MB for better compatibility with version control systems.
